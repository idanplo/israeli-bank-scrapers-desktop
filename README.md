## Security Principles

This app has two main principles:

1. **Local running:** This app accesses the bank's website exactly the same way you do.  
Therefore, you don't have to rely on a third party to keep your passwords.

2. **Open Source:** Don't believe me the information wasn't sent out?
The source code is right here. Read it! (or ask a friend to). See for yourself that there is no malicious code here.

## Welcome to the beta

The project is currently in beta, which means we focus on two main goals:

1. **Minimal Valuable Flow:**  
Bringing the app to a level where the user can perform the minimum flow - importing and exporting data in a convenient and clear way, without any critical bugs.

2. **Open Source Project:**  
Bringing the project to a stage where it is easy for new contributors to understand and contribute to. This includes good documentation, testing, etc.

When you look at the project, please try to think about both of these goals.

## Contributing

The project is an *Electron* app, with *Vue* in the front-end, and mainly uses [israeli-bank-scrapers](https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers) project.

### I need your help

This is the first time I'm writing code in *NodeJS*, and of course it's the first time I'm using *Electron* and *Vue*.

I wrote this version "quick and dirty", because the goal was to get to the solution up and running as quickly as possible. If there is interest, I can continue to develop the app as I work on other projects as well, and of course I would love to get help.

Please note that we are currently in **beta**, and issues under [Beta Milestone](https://github.com/baruchiro/israeli-bank-scrapers-desktop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3ABeta) are prioritized.

### Build Setup

#### Linux

Currently, this project depends on `libsecret`, so you may need to install it before running `yarn`.

Depending on your distribution, you will need to run the following command:

* Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`
* Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`
* Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`

Then you can run the commands below:

#### Windows / Linux
``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
yarn dev

# build electron application for production
yarn build

# run unit & end-to-end tests
yarn test

yarn lint

```
